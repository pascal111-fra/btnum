"Battle of numbers".
It's a taditional BASIC game, and I tried to convert it by my way into visual programming style by Lazarus free Pascal. I didn't finish all of my work
on it but the code and forms have all basic features of this game, and the particular part need modification by understanding the original author vision of the game
is the part of how the computer calculate its moves.
