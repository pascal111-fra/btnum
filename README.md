# btnum
"Battle of numbers".
It's a taditional BASIC game, and I tried to convert it by my way into visual programming style by Lazarus free Pascal. I didn't finish all of my work
on it but the code and forms have all basic features of this game, and the particular part need modification by understanding the original author vision of the game
is the part of how the computer calculate its moves.

It's originally written by one of the two originators of BASIC language "John Kemeny of Dartmouth college".

I converted this game into visual programming style by Lazarus free Pascal using the version of the game written by "CREATIVE COMPUTING MORRISTOWN, NEW JESRSEY".

The computer will ask you about the amount of a pile of imagined objects which will be taken as parts each time and each turn from you or from computer, you can determine if the loser is the one who takes the last amount of the pile or he who will leave it.

The game source is on "GitHub", search for "pascal111-fra/btnum", I'm not sure of the part I programmed for the computer calculation its takes, maybe I didn't complete idea of the vision of the original author of the game, you can modify it or comment to me on "GitHub.
